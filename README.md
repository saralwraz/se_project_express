# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. There are two collections of data, users and items of clothing, and they work inside a database created in MongoDB. This project uses schemas, controllers, and routes to assemble item and user requirements that will place them in the appropriate parts in the database. The site also uses middleware for validation of both items and users, and disallows invalid data like duplicate email submissions and improperly submitted clothing item data.

## This project relied on these technologies or applications

*Javascript
*express
*ESLint
*Postman
*MongoDB
*CORS was also installed, which will be used in connecting the front and backend parts of the WTWR app.
